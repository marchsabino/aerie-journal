  This is the current page that you are on. In essence, this page is here for
  you as your roadmap to the control panel.
  <h6 class="border-bottom border-gray pb-2 mt-3">Forums</h6>
  Forums allow the Aerie Journal Staff to communicate easily over the website.
  In your current role, you have the following capabilities within the Forums:
  <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">

    <li>Delete your own threads</li>
    <li>Comment on threads</li>
    <li>Delete your own comments</li>

    </ng-container>
  </ul>
  <h6 class="border-bottom border-gray pb-2 mt-3">Announcements</h6>
  Announcements show at the top of the website on all pages with a yellow
  background. These are useful when you want to get word out about certain
  things. Such as: events, due dates, or best wishes. Announcements all have
  "start" and "end" dates that are set and will only appear on the page when it
  falls within that timeframe. Only one announcement can be made at a single
  time.
  <ul class="mt-3">
    <li>Create new announcements</li>
    <li>Delete existing announcements</li>
  </ul>
